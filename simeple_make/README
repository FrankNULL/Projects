• The purpose of your program

The purpose of our program is:
1) emulate make system call to write a simple make 
2) parse the input makefile 
3) decide the order of recipes to execute 
4) execute recipes for specific target

• How to compile the program
1）run terminal 
2）change to current directory 
3）type "make"
The makefile will automatically generate a executable mymake

• What exactly your program does
parse the input makefile into an array of targets and add those targets into a graph 
 when calling $ ./mymake -p makefile, print all targets with its dependencies and recipes
 when calling $ ./mymake -r makefile, print the recipes in order of execution.
 when calling $ ./mymake makefile, execute recipes in order to fulfill the first target.
 when calling $ ./mymake makefile target, execute recipes in order to fulfill the given target
