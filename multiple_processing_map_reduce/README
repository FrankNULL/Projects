• The purpose of your program

The purpose of our program is:
1) emulate map-reduce process
2) traverse directories and files and spilt fils into mapper_i file
3) mapper process read content of files and send info to pipes
4) reducer receive info and put together and write into ReduceResult.txt file
5) output result from ReduceResult to FinaLResult by using system calls

• How to compile the program
1）run terminal
2）change to /src directory
3）type "make"
The makefile will automatically generate a executable mapreduce

• What exactly your program does
phase1: create folder, traverse directories and insert the filepath
phase2: assign mapper processes with Mapper_i files, create a list of info and send it to pipes
phase3: reducer process read from pipes and output to a file
phase4: master process output to a final file by using system calls
